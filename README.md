# MyReact

This is a project built with the aim of creating a React-like library from scratch, with the idea of learning the fundamental concepts of how React works. The library provides a component-based structure for building user interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

**myReact.js** This file contains the implementation of the myReact component-based library.

**script.js** This file contains the implementation of a sample project that uses the myReact library to fetch data from a JSON file and build a table based on that data.

**index.html** : This file contains the HTML code that serves as a placeholder for the React components that are created using the **myReact** library.

**handleJson.json** : This file contains functions to handle CRUD operations of the myTailwind.json file via the command line. To launch the file and access its functionality, use the following command on your terminal/command line:
```
PS C:\myReact> node .\handleJson.js 

[=== Menu ====]
Select an option:
1. updateID
2. addData
``` 
**myTailwind.json** : This file contains data to use for Tailwind styles using classNames.

## Usage

The project can be run by opening the index.html file in a browser. This file serves as a placeholder for the components that are built using the myReact library. The components are constructed using JavaScript code in the script.js file.

## Contributions

The project is open to contributions, and the developers will be glad to receive contributions in form of issues, bug reports, and pull requests.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built with the idea of learning the fundamental concepts of React, and it's not intended to be used in production environments. The code is open-sourced and available for learning purposes only.

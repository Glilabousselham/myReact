# MyReact

This is a project built with the aim of creating a React-like library from scratch, with the idea of learning the fundamental concepts of how React works. The library provides a component-based structure for building user interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

**myReact.js** This file contains the implementation of the myReact component-based library.

**script.js** This file contains the implementation of a sample project that uses the myReact library to fetch data from a JSON file and build a table based on that data.

**index.html** : This file contains the HTML code that serves as a placeholder for the React components that are created using the **myReact** library.

**handleJson.json** : This file contains the sample JSON data that is used in the script.js file to build the table.

**myTailwind.json** : This file contains the configuration for the Tailwind CSS library.

## Usage

The project can be run by opening the index.html file in a browser. This file serves as a placeholder for the components that are built using the myReact library. The components are constructed using JavaScript code in the script.js file.

## Contributions

The project is open to contributions, and the developers will be glad to receive contributions in form of issues, bug reports, and pull requests.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built with the idea of learning the fundamental concepts of React, and it's not intended to be used in production environments. The code is open-sourced and available for learning purposes only.
